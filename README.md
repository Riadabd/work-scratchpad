This is a scratchpad that contains programs written for a specific (or sometimes slight more general) purpose. The idea here is to congregate all these utilities in one place and iterate on them whenever they are needed and whenever there is enough time to do so.

These mini-projects will most likely contain lots of commented out code as the main purpose of this scratchpad is to be an experimentation hub and not a place where things are structured correctly right off the bat.
